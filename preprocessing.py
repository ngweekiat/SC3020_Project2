Purpose:
    - Handles input processing and preparatory tasks required by the application.

Requirements:
    1. Load and validate input data:
        - Ensure the TPC-H dataset is correctly loaded and available for querying.
        - Validate the correctness and format of user-supplied SQL queries.
    2. Preprocessing tasks for:
        - Visualizing the QEP (e.g., formatting data structures for tree representation).
        - Modifying the QEP (e.g., mapping user edits to the query plan structure).
    3. Provide support functions for other modules:
        - Data extraction from PostgreSQL.
        - Preparing data for visualization in the GUI.
