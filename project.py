project.py
-----------
Purpose:
    - The main entry point for the application, orchestrating the execution of all modules.

Requirements:
    1. Invoke necessary procedures from `interface.py`, `whatif.py`, and `preprocessing.py`.
    2. Handle:
        - Initialization of the application.
        - Dependency checks and setup (e.g., installing required libraries).
        - Execution of the workflow from user input to result output.
    3. Ensure modularity:
        - Act as a coordinator, delegating tasks to the appropriate module without duplicating logic.
