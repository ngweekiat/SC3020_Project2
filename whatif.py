----------
Purpose:
    - Handles the logic for generating modified SQL queries and their corresponding AQPs (Alternative Query Plans) based on what-if questions.

Requirements:
    1. Accept as input:
        - The original SQL query.
        - User modifications to the QEP (e.g., changes in operators, join order).
    2. Generate:
        - The modified SQL query reflecting the user edits.
        - The modified QEP (AQP) using PostgreSQL's planner method configuration.
    3. Retrieve and compare:
        - The estimated cost of the AQP with the original QEP.
    4. Ensure generality:
        - Handle a wide variety of queries and database schemas.
        - Avoid hardcoding schema-specific or query-specific logic.
